This is a relatively small knowledge graph that is used as an example for how a concept can be expanded and represented in GraphHub.\r\n\r\n#### Introduction\r\n\r\nGraphHub, currently in its beta stage, is a versatile tool offering a comprehensive platform for capturing and systematizing information about concepts by categorizing them into coherent lists. Whether you're a user, developer, or enthusiast, this tool is geared to aid you!.\r\n\r\n#### Features\r\n\r\n1. **Knowledge Graph Creation**: The platform facilitates the creation of a dynamic knowledge graph by enabling the addition of concepts and the establishment of connections between various Tesla concepts. It allows the representation of diverse concepts such as art styles, photography techniques, digital art genres, and virtually any concept of your choosing!\r\n\r\n2. **Visual Exploration**: The knowledge graph offers a visually intuitive depiction of the relationships between various Tesla concepts.\r\n\r\n3. **Collaboration and Sharing**: The platform enhances collaboration by allowing you to share your knowledge graph with others. You can invite team members or fellow enthusiasts to contribute their unique insights, annotations, and additions to the graph. This fosters a collaborative ecosystem where ideas can thrive, and knowledge can be collectively constructed.\r\n\r\n4. **Export and Integration**: This tool will soon provide native support for exporting all the information, as well as an API for the tech-savvy among you. The tool is open-source, and the complete graph can be found on GitHub.\r\n\r\n#### Getting Started\r\n\r\nBegin by exploring the lists owned by this concept.\r\n\r\n#### GraphHub Beta\r\n\r\nI'm vigorously working on expanding the functionality to soon enable users to:\r\n1. Search\r\n2. Contribute\r\n3. Administer\/Moderate\r\n\r\nFor ideas or suggestions, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn @ Daniel Hai](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/daniel-hai\/).\r\n\r\nAlso check out my DevLog which follows the development of GraphHub.\r\n\r\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/JJBO2r0F1Ug\/0.jpg)](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JJBO2r0F1Ug \"Video Title\")\r\n\r\n### Tesla Graph Taxonomy and Ontology\r\n\r\nThe structure is pretty strait forward with the exception of car features where there is a single common list that inherits some features to all specific car feature lists.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that that is an all features car list that pulls all the features from all car lists.\r\n\r\n#### Hierarchy\r\n\r\n* [Tesla](1c1b4890-7e8a-4f1f-a7e3-5b71e8e303d0)\r\n    * [Tesla Vehicles](3b17f9e2-3801-45b4-8e26-7913645c96b4)\r\n        * [Model S](71740b3a-20b6-46ee-a179-cf76ac687c5e)\r\n            * [Model S Features](b8ef4ed7-bb82-4b13-8d03-0a37d6b2b470)\r\n                * [Extended Range](1ff2ff92-3e3b-42f6-8d36-76434c7a6b56)\r\n                * [Premium Interior](b4dcd097-c86c-4ad2-b682-24357710a9c6)\r\n                * [Advanced Air Filtration](803b364e-4919-4fbb-8b26-c7ea366c2fd7)\r\n                * [Common Car Features](725791c6-4ee4-4c64-8475-4d2fe7793075)\r\n        * [Model 3](4f731b4d-4142-4df5-bdf1-531e4edf25fb)\r\n            * [Model 3 Features](d62c05e4-1dd7-4f2b-aa6e-d70e3c9efb55)\r\n                * [Standard Range Plus](69fda6c9-bd38-418a-b9ff-4edbbd5da6f1)\r\n                * [Autopilot](f29beeb6-6ed3-4e09-8574-8b09c7b5f32a)\r\n                * [Supercharging Capabilities](96d26d07-d1e5-4060-86a5-14f89a3dbd76)\r\n                * [Common Car Features](725791c6-4ee4-4c64-8475-4d2fe7793075)\r\n        * [Model X](6e7c8a11-251e-4c2b-b0ea-b25ee690ad8f)\r\n            * [Model X Features](96e85f4a-3a61-4f39-a12b-398b3b31c4e0)\r\n                * [Falcon Wing Doors](08e4686e-2473-4aef-81d2-0d41b02b1072)\r\n                * [Largest Panoramic Windshield](0c75a9e4-6c71-4a9d-b1e9-5fc1185df2e7)\r\n                * [Seven-Passenger Seating](a08b8e85-c54c-4f0a-881e-383a2f19c3b7)\r\n                * [Common Car Features](725791c6-4ee4-4c64-8475-4d2fe7793075)\r\n        * [Model Y](60a4e24a-68c5-4326-ba3d-c5f3f4d2e0ce)\r\n            * [Model Y Features](c196d7e1-08d9-43c2-87eb-4229a7b40f6d)\r\n                * [Compact SUV Design](91e5c0a3-9076-4b46-852d-40fbac98d6a9)\r\n                * [Spacious Interior](d7b8e4f0-9030-43fc-9b43-8abab1663f3d)\r\n                * [Versatile Cargo Space](c2f4b7b6-431b-4d81-8e89-28c135f5a860)\r\n                * [Common Car Features](725791c6-4ee4-4c64-8475-4d2fe7793075)\r\n        * [Cybertruck](79163f7b-69f6-4d1f-84f2-c8aeb1a18e0a)\r\n            * [Cybertruck Features](f91cb139-ae7b-4154-90a6-c02c7037d8fd)\r\n                * [Stainless Steel Exoskeleton](2a59c11e-2a7d-4d8d-8295-9a6fe52ddcac)\r\n                * [Armor Glass](8608cb54-08db-494c-a8d5-0c4d3e1e74b7)\r\n                * [Vault Storage](f29d1e9f-4d6f-4254-bde6-5cc2c63c8fc0)\r\n                * [Common Car Features](725791c6-4ee4-4c64-8475-4d2fe7793075)\r\n        * [Roadster](c43d5c5a-2c63-4c7e-a116-ae2bdc823650)\r\n            * [Roadster Features](1e8a8dd5-8e8e-4f35-8030-5b7f44d61fd5)\r\n                * [Record-Breaking Acceleration](48662a92-3f8a-42f4-a7b9-72f3b70d784e)\r\n                * [Convertible Roof](2a69547b-c6eb-4e1d-9d61-8436a7a48df7)\r\n                * [Maximum Range](d72ed71b-803e-4f08-b1ff-618e9fe6b6f0)\r\n                * [Common Car Features](725791c6-4ee4-4c64-8475-4d2fe7793075)\r\n* [Tesla Technologies](0a62de7e-72c7-426a-a46b-1db6483a3a4b)\r\n    * [Autopilot](00e144d1-7782-476f-961d-32ed54766f3d)\r\n    * [Full Self-Driving](3a61e28e-bbbd-45b9-96b3-972a6d367b8f)\r\n    * [Supercharger Network](79b5e3c5-5e3d-48b3-939d-f772e6de39e7)\r\n    * [Gigafactory](cdc286af-b4f9-4c4e-9824-0a9e11ef0b85)\r\n    * [Battery Technology](26f1609c-6511-486a-8d29-4e14e8a3610a)\r\n    * [Solar Technology](d6f7250e-8c53-4347-8a3d-2f51a4255b23)\r\n    * [Energy Storage](8ed27ac6-26e9-4c07-b99a-3c57abce56e0)\r\n    * [AI and Machine Learning](01a02139-d110-4ad7-a2d7-ae1a535fde9b)\r\n* Supporting Lists\r\n    * [Common Car Features](725791c6-4ee4-4c64-8475-4d2fe7793075)\r\n        * [Electric Motor](78f049da-ae3d-4c18-b57f-99e216b7eaf7)\r\n        * [Lithium-Ion Battery](4be05f44-8cbe-405b-b1f5-0ef09a80d997)\r\n        * [Touchscreen Display](3b60e8f4-6f80-4b57-8a51-660d84c65e8f)\r\n    * [All Car Features](7105a233-0a6f-45b4-93c3-3966c00a0f78)"
